# coffemud-gui
I want some experience with Mudlet mapping functions before I set up mapping for The Eternal Fantasy, and I want to use GMCP for it because I'll be using that.

MarisaG on Discord had the lucky timing to ask someone to work on a mapper for CoffeeMud right as I was debating this.  So now I'm trying this out.

It is here for my own convenience and not in any form usable really.  Currently it will build a map somewhat but spam you with debugging messages.

I'll do some basic GUI but keep the mapper separate because that's really what people are interested in.
